## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

**imports**

```{r}
housing<- read.csv("hpi_at_state.csv")
prices_1980 = read.csv("corrected_state_base_prices_1980.csv")
state_lookup <- data.frame(
  state_abb = state.abb,
  state_name = state.name
)
```

**Prices 1980**

```{r}
prices_1980
```

**clean and join data**

```{r}
housing_clean <- housing|>
  filter(X1 == 1)|>
  rename(State = AK,
         Year = X1975)|>
  select(-X1)|>
  left_join(state_lookup, by= join_by(State == state_abb))|>
  left_join(prices_1980, by = join_by(state_name == state))|>
  mutate(avg_housing_prices = (X61.63/100)*base_price_1980)
 
housing_clean
```

Write to file

```{r}
write.csv(housing_clean, "housing_prices_for_tobe.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
